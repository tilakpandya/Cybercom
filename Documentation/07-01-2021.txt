today i start watching some youtube tutorials about git commands like endureka, telusko etc.
started doing same basic local repo creation.

created some branches and merged with master branch.
resolved some merge conflicts.
tried to revert commits.

had got to know about few new commands like git config, git rebase, git commit -a -m "first commit"(add+commit).
