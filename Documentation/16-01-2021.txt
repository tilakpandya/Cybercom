Annonymous function example.
Immedietly Invoke Function Expressions.
Closure function eg InterviewQuestion("teacher")("Shital").

With the call() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
var person = {
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}
var person1 = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe"
}
var person2 = {
  firstName:"Mary",
  lastName: "Doe"
}
person.fullName.call(person1);  // Will return "John Doe"

var is a function scoped.
let and const is block scoped because of data privacy.

Use of `` eg.console.log(`he is {$name} from {$city} and studying in {$clgName}`);
