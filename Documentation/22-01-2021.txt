Today i start with PHP tutorials.
PHP is server side scripting language because it's not visible by other people.
PHP is Hypertext Preprocessor.
Need Xampp to start work with PHP
Store files in htdoc.
extention is .php
Start with <?php and end with ?>.
index.php is by defualt name to run program.
phpinfo() to check all details about php version and all.
php.ini file contains default settings for php and you can modify that.
to print anything need to use echo ""; we can also use html tags inside echo"".
echo is marginally faster than print.echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.
'' is use inside "" and '' quicker than ""
embedding php in html : <input type="text" value="<?php echo $text; ?>">
// for single line comment and /*...*/ for multiline comment
check Error handling and logging for different list of errors and warnings.
E_ALL 	 - for all errors and warnings. 
E_STRICT - Runtime Notices, suggest you to make change in your code so your program goes appropriatly.
ini_set('error_reporting','E_ALL'); - set value of error_reporting to E_ALL.
concatenation: echo 'the date is'.$date.' '.$month.' '.$year;  or echo "the date is $date $month $year"; 
=== use to check value as well as type.
die('message'); - stop execution further.
	eg. msql_connect('localhost','root','') or die('Error in connection');
